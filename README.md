# CommunityAppJava
Community is an invitation-only social networking app with a Java back-end and iOS front-end. This app allows the user be invited into organizations and see events as well as posts associated with the organizations that they are a member of. 

The Java back-end is a set of web services that connect a relational Postgres database to the iOS front-end.
